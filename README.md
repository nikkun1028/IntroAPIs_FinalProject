## Submission Checklist:
1. `README.md` on root repo âœ…
2. `.sql` code for database âœ…
3. three API endpoints and three HTTP methods ðŸ›‘
4. at least one controller âœ…
5. basic response model (statusCode, statusDescription, list of items) âœ…

<br />
<br />

## Documentation:
what's this API about?
> Monster Hunter API allowsÂ a clientÂ to see information about player, player's weapon equipment, and its weapon type.

endpoints and HTTP methods that a client can use:
> 3 endpoints are following: <br />
`api/Player` <br />
`api/Weapon` <br />
`api/WeaponType` <br/>

> HTTP methods for each endpoint: <br />
`GET, api/Player` will return a list of all players <br />
`GET, api/Player/ID` will return a player of ID specified <br />
`POST, api/Player` will add a new player to the players list <br />
`DELETE, api/Player/ID` will delete the player with ID from the list <br />
`GET, api/Weapon` will return a list of all weapons <br />
`GET, api/Weapon/ID` will return a weapon of ID specified <br />
`POST, api/Weapon` will add a new weapon to the weapons list <br />
`DELETE, api/Weapon/ID` will delete the weapon with ID from the list <br />
`GET, api/WeaponType` will return a list of all weapon types <br />
`GET, api/WeaponType/ID` will return a weapon type of ID specified <br />




sample request/response body:
> this is a request body for POST api/Player <br />
any misspelling of the property name will cause it to be null <br />
which will possibly throw an error because of the database constraints.
```
{
  "playerName": "example_name", 
  "weapon": {
    "weaponType": {
      "weaponTypeID": 1,
      "weaponTypeName": "Great Sword"
    },
    "weaponName": "example_weapon",
    "atk": 100,
    "critical": 0
  }
}
```



sample response body:
> this is a response body for GET api/Weapon/4 <br />
```
{
  "statusCode": 200,
  "statusDescription": "GET successful",
  "weapons":[{ 
    "weaponID":4,"weaponType":null,"weaponName":"Kamura Glintblades I","atk":50,"critical":0
   }]
}
```

## Problems/Concerns:
Wanted to add more to the database about Monsters too, but it's going to be useless for this project (since it's not connected to any of other tables) so I decided not to include here. Also I gave up implementing Armors tables since I thought connecting 6 different tables to just Player table might be too much. I wanted this project to be less data. ðŸ˜ƒ

## MonsterHunter Rise/SunBreak:
it's a very good game you should play.
