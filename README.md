## Documentation:
what's this API about?
> Monster Hunter API allowsÂ a clientÂ to see information about player, player's weapon equipment, and its weapon type.

endpoints that a client can use:
> 3 endpoints and available HTTP methods for each endpoint are following: <br />
```GET, POST, DELETE     api/Player``` <br />
```GET, POST, DELETE     api/Weapon``` <br />
```GET                  api/WeaponType```

sample request body:
> this is request body for POST api/Player <br />
```
{
  "playerName": "example_name", 
  "weapon": {
    "weaponType": {
      "weaponTypeID": 1,
      "weaponTypeName": "Great Sword"
    },
    "weaponName": "example_weapon",
    "atk": 100,
    "critical": 0
  }
}
```



sample response body:
> this is response body for GET api/Weapon/4 <br />
```{"weaponID":4,"weaponType":null,"weaponName":"Kamura Glintblades I","atk":50,"critical":0}```

<br />
<br />

## Problems/Concerns:
Wanted to add more to the database about Monsters too, but it's going to be useless (since not really connected to any of other tables) for this project so I decided not to include here. 

<br />
<br />

## MonsterHunter Rise/SunBreak:
it's a very good game you should play.
